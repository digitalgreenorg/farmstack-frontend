## System Requirements

### Deploy and set up farmstack on your infrastructure.

Minimum Requirement

```
vCPUs 2
RAM(GiB) 4.0
Persistent Memory(GB) 50
Operating System Linux
```

We use Docker to package the farmstack application. Hence, docker should be installed as pre-requisite.

*RAM is directly proportional to the number of datasets with size processing done concurrently.*

*Persistent Memory is directly proportional to the number of datasets you would like to store in Farmstack.*

### Run farmstack on your local

Follow the instructions given in the INSTALLER_GUIDE document to set up the farmstack frontend and backend along with any relational database of your choice.
