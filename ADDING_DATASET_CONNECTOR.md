Adding a New Dataset Connector
This guide details the process for adding a new dataset connector to our system. By following these steps, developers can ensure consistency and maintainability across our dataset integration efforts.

Overview
Creating a new dataset connector involves generating a template-based component and integrating it into our system. This document outlines the necessary steps and provides guidance for completing each part of the process.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

Node.js and npm installed on your machine
Basic understanding of React and Mongoose schemas
Access to our project repository with the necessary permissions
Step 1: Generate the Dataset Connector Component
To streamline the creation of dataset connectors, we utilize a script that generates a component based on predefined templates.

Run the Script: Execute the script by running the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
npm run create:dataset-connector
Provide Required Information: The script will prompt you for several pieces of information:

Connector Name: The identifier for the connector. This name is used to create the component file.
Component Name: The React component function's name.
Label: A user-friendly label for the connector displayed in the UI.
Example Input
Connector Name: MyConnector
Component Name: MyComponent
Label: My Data Connector
The script generates a new component in src/default-templates/ based on your input.

Step 2: Integrate the Connector
After generating the component, integrate it into the system to make it available for use.

Navigate to UploadFile.js: Open the file located at src/Components/Datasets_New/TabComponents/.

Modify the Conditional Rendering: Add an else if condition to render your newly created component when the connector name matches.

javascript
Copy code
if (condition) {
// Pre-existing conditions
} else if (connectorName === 'MyConnector') {
return <MyComponent />;
}
Update the UI: Ensure your connector's label is correctly displayed and associated with your component.

Best Practices
Ensure the component name and connector name are unique within the project.
Implement comprehensive error handling within your component.
Test the connector extensively to ensure it integrates seamlessly with existing datasets and UI components.
